    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies a system by which OpenPGP clients may subscribe to an organization's key-list and keep its internal keystore up-to-date. Ensuring that all members of an organization have their colleagues' most recent PGP keys is critical
        to maintaining operational security. To enable cross-client key-list compatibility, this document proposes a standard format for the key-list file as well as feature requirements for OpenPGP clients who wish to implement this functionality.
