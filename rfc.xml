    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies a system by which OpenPGP clients may subscribe to
        an organization's keylist and keep its internal keystore up-to-date. Ensuring
        that all members of an organization have their colleagues' most recent PGP
        keys is critical to maintaining operational security. To enable cross-client
        compatibility, this document proposes a standard format for the keylist file
        as well as feature requirements for OpenPGP clients who wish to implement
        this functionality.

    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>This document specifies a system by which OpenPGP clients may subscribe to
        a cryptographically signed keylist published by an organization. This system
        allows for seamless key rotation across an entire organization and enhances
        operational security. The user interface by which an OpenPGP client provides
        this functionality to the user is out of scope, as is the process by which
        the OpenPGP client retrieves keys. Other non-security-related implementation
        details are also out of scope. To enable cross-client compatibility, this
        document instead provides a standard format for the keylist, its cryptographic
        verification, and the method by which it is retreived over the Internet.

        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
          "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are
          to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

      <section anchor="terminology" title="Terminology">
        <t>This document uses the terms "OpenPGP", "public key", "private key", "signature",
          "keystore", and "fingerprint" defined by OpenPGP Message Format [RFC4880].
        </t>
        <!-- TODO: verify that all the previous terms are actually defined in RFC4880. ~MM -->
        <!-- TODO: does 'URI' and 'Internet' need a citation? Probably not, but we should check. ~MM -->
        <t>The term "keylist" is defined as a list of OpenPGP keys identified by their
          fingerprints accessible via a URI. The exact format of this data is specified
          in "Data Element Formats".

      <section anchor="functions" title="General Functions">
        <t>As new keys are creates and other keys are revoked, it is critical that all
          members of an organization have the most recent set of keys available on
          their computers. Keylists enable organizations to publish a directory of
          OpenPGP keys that OpenPGP clients can use to keep their internal keystores
          up-to-date. A single OpenPGP client may subscribe to many different keylists,
          or none at all.
